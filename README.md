**Photoshop Automation Script for Masks**

This script automates the process of creating a layer mask in Photoshop and filling it with black, then creating a selection based on the image's edges and filling it with white to reveal the image.

**Requirements**

This script requires Adobe Photoshop to be installed on your computer.

**Usage**

  Open Adobe Photoshop.
  Open the image you want to apply the layer mask to.
  Open the ExtendScript Toolkit (ESTK) by going to File > Scripts > Open Script Editor.
  Copy and paste the code from the script file into the ESTK.
  Modify the file paths in the script to match the location of your image file and the location where you want to save the file.
  Save the script and run it by clicking the Play button in the ESTK.
  The script will create a layer mask and fill it with black, then create a selection based on the image's edges and fill it with white to reveal the image. It will then save the file to the location you specified and close the image file.
  Note: This script is intended as a starting point for automating mask creation in Photoshop. You may need to modify the script to suit your specific needs.
